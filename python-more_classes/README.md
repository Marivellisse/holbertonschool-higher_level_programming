# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project focuses on deepening the understanding of Python classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It builds on earlier Python basics, adding complexity through special methods, instance management, and static/class methods.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the difference between a class and an object
- Define a class and create instances
- Use instance and class attributes
- Utilize special methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__del__`
- Manage object lifecycle (instantiation and deletion)
- Use class methods and static methods
- Implement and use class attributes effectively

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- Code style: `pycodestyle` 2.7.*
- No module imports are allowed
- Files must be executable and end with a new line
- All modules, classes, and methods must have proper docstrings

## Files and Descriptions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-rectangle.py` | Defines an empty class `Rectangle`. |
| `1-rectangle.py` | Adds private instance attributes `width` and `height` with property getters and setters. |
| `2-rectangle.py` | Adds `area()` and `perimeter()` public instance methods. |
| `3-rectangle.py` | Adds `__str__()` for string representation using `#` characters. |
| `4-rectangle.py` | Adds `__repr__()` to recreate the object using `eval()`. |
| `5-rectangle.py` | Adds `__del__()` to detect deletion and print a message. |
| `6-rectangle.py` | Adds class attribute `number_of_instances` to track instance count. |
| `7-rectangle.py` | Adds `print_symbol` class attribute to customize print character. |
| `8-rectangle.py` | Adds static method `bigger_or_equal()` to compare rectangles by area. |
| `9-rectangle.py` | Adds class method `square()` to create square-shaped rectangles. |
