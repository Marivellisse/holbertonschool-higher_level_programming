# Python - Object-relational mapping

This project explores how to interact with MySQL databases using both low-level drivers like `MySQLdb` and high-level Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like `SQLAlchemy`.

---

## üìö Learning Objectives

- Understand what Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is.
- Connect to a MySQL server from a Python script.
- Run MySQL queries from Python using `MySQLdb`.
- Prevent SQL injection in queries.
- Use SQLAlchemy to map Python classes to MySQL tables.
- Perform CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL 8.0
- MySQLdb (mysqlclient)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Ubuntu 20.04 / macOS

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Install MySQL and Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install mysqlclient SQLAlchemy
   ```

2. Start MySQL service and create required databases and tables using provided `.sql` files.

3. Run each script using:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.py <mysql_user> <mysql_password> <database_name> [<state_name>]
   ```

## üìå Notes

- All scripts use `MySQLdb` or `SQLAlchemy` and follow Holberton's Python style.
- Input validation is not required per project instructions.
- Scripts are executable and should not run when imported.
