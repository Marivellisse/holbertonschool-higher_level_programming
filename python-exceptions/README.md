# Python Exceptions

## Description
This project covers the fundamentals of exception handling in Python. Students will implement safe operations involving printing, division, and list handling using try/except blocks. The focus is on creating robust code that can handle unexpected inputs or behaviors gracefully.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the purpose of exceptions in Python
- Properly use `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions
- Use the `finally` clause
- Raise exceptions using `raise`
- Create custom error messages
- Avoid common runtime errors in list and number operations

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Use `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- No use of external libraries or modules unless specified

## Task Overview

### 0. Safe print list
Print the first `x` elements of a list, catching exceptions.

### 1. Safe print integer
Safely print an integer using a try/except block.

### 2. Safe print list integers
Print only the integers from a mixed list.

### 3. Safe print division
Safely divide two numbers and return the result.

### 4. List division
Divide element-wise two lists and store the result in a new list.

### 5. Raise exception

### 6. Raise exception with message
