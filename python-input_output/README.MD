# Python - Input/Output

## Description

This project focuses on practicing file input and output (I/O) operations in Python, including reading and writing files, serializing and deserializing data using JSON, and interacting with command-line arguments. You will learn how to manipulate files using context managers (`with` statement), use the `json` module to store and retrieve complex data structures, and implement data persistence in Python applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of file I/O in Python.
- Open, read, write, and close files properly.
- Use the `with` statement to manage file contexts.
- Use JSON to serialize and deserialize Python data.
- Understand how to save and load objects from files.
- Work with command-line arguments in Python scripts.
- Understand serialization and deserialization of class instances.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all scripts must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).
- All scripts must be executable.
- All test files must be `.txt` and live in a `tests` folder.
- Documentation is required for all modules, classes, and functions.

- **Task 7:** Add command-line arguments to a list and save to file.
- **Task 8:** Convert a class instance to a dictionary for JSON serialization.
- **Task 9–11:** Work with a `Student` class to serialize, filter, and reload instances.
- **Task 12:** Implement Pascal’s Triangle generator.
