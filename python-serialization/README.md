# Python - Serialization

This project focuses on implementing different serialization techniques using Python. Serialization is the process of converting data structures into a format that can be saved or transmitted and reconstructed later.

## Project Tasks

### 0. Basic Serialization
Serialize a Python dictionary into a JSON file and deserialize it back.

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes
Use the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize instances of a custom Python class.

### 2. CSV to JSON Conversion
Convert data from CSV format to JSON using the `csv` and `json` modules.

### 3. XML Serialization
Serialize and deserialize Python dictionaries using XML format with `xml.etree.ElementTree`.

## Usage

All scripts are executable and follow the `pycodestyle` standard (PEP8). Test files are provided for each task.
