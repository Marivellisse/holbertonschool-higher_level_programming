# Python Classes

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and introduces the concept of **object-oriented programming in Python**, specifically the use of **classes**, **attributes**, and **methods**. The tasks progressively develop a class `Square`, reinforcing the principles of encapsulation, data validation, and method definition.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what a class is in Python
- Create and instantiate classes
- Define and use private instance attributes
- Use `@property` and `@property.setter` decorators
- Write and apply custom methods in a class
- Validate data types and values
- Format output using custom print methods

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All `.py` files must:
  - Start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - End with a new line
  - Be executable (`chmod +x`)
  - Be `pycodestyle` compliant (version 2.7.*)
- Each module, class, and method must contain a full and descriptive docstring.

## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-square.py` | Empty class `Square` |
| `1-square.py` | Class with private instance attribute `size` |
| `2-square.py` | Adds size validation in the constructor |
| `3-square.py` | Adds public method `area()` to calculate square area |
| `4-square.py` | Adds getter/setter using `@property` for `size` |
| `5-square.py` | Adds `my_print()` method to display square using `#` |
| `6-square.py` | Adds `position` attribute and offsets square printing |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

Each file is tested using a corresponding `main.py` provided in the task, and adheres to all formatting and exception-handling requirements.

---

## Usage

You can run each module individually by executing the test file:

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
...
./6-main.py
