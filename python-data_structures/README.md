Python Project: Data Structures - Lists, Tuples, Sequences

📚 Description

This Holberton School project focuses on practicing Python data structures, specifically lists and tuples. Students complete a set of tasks that strengthen their understanding of core operations such as indexing, slicing, mutability, tuple packing/unpacking, and using sequences effectively.

🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand and use Python lists

Compare strings and lists

Apply common list methods (append, insert, pop, slicing, etc.)

Use lists as stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO)

Write list comprehensions

Understand tuple syntax and when to use tuples

Define sequences and identify their properties

Apply tuple packing and unpacking

Use the del statement to delete elements from a list or variables

✅ Requirements

Python 3.8.5

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

All scripts start with: #!/usr/bin/python3

Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)

All files must be executable

No external modules are allowed

All files end with a new line

File length is tested with wc

🧠 Tasks Summary

0. Print a List of Integers

Function that prints each integer in a list using str.format().

1. Secure Access to List Element

Function that safely returns an element at a specific index. Returns None if index is invalid.

2. Replace Element

Function that updates an element at a given index, only if the index is valid.

3. Print List in Reverse

Prints a list of integers in reverse order using a loop and str.format().

4. Replace in a Copy

Creates a new copy of a list with a replaced element. Original list is not modified.

5. Remove 'c' and 'C'

Returns a copy of the string with all 'c' and 'C' characters removed (without using replace).

6. Print Matrix

Prints a 2D matrix of integers, using nested loops and str.format().

7. Add Tuples

Returns the element-wise addition of two tuples. Handles tuples with less than two items.

8. More Returns

Function returns the length of a string and its first character as a tuple. If string is empty, first character is None.

9. Find the Max

Returns the largest integer in a list (without using the built-in max() function).

10. Divisible by 2

Checks which elements of a list are divisible by 2. Returns a list of booleans.

11. Delete at Index

Deletes an item in a list at a given index. Returns the modified list.

12. Switch Values

Short program that switches the values of two variables in exactly 5 lines.
