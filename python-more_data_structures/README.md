# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary, Lambda

## 📚 Description

This project explores advanced Python data structures and functional programming concepts. You will learn how to manipulate **sets** and **dictionaries**, how to **iterate** over them efficiently, and how to apply **lambda**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce** functions in real scenarios.

This project is part of the **Holberton School** curriculum.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what **sets** are and when to use them over lists
- Use common **set methods**: `add()`, `update()`, `difference()`, etc.
- Work with **dictionaries** and understand key-value storage
- Choose between **dictionaries, sets, and lists** based on context
- Iterate over dictionaries and sets efficiently
- Use **lambda functions** for short, anonymous operations
- Understand and use `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for functional programming tasks
