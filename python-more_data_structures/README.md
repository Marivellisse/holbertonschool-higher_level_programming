# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary, Lambda

## 📚 Description

This project explores advanced Python data structures and functional programming concepts. You will learn how to manipulate **sets** and **dictionaries**, how to **iterate** over them efficiently, and how to apply **lambda**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce** functions in real scenarios.

This project is part of the **Holberton School** curriculum.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what **sets** are and when to use them over lists
- Use common **set methods**: `add()`, `update()`, `difference()`, etc.
- Work with **dictionaries** and understand key-value storage
- Choose between **dictionaries, sets, and lists** based on context
- Iterate over dictionaries and sets efficiently
- Use **lambda functions** for short, anonymous operations
- Understand and use `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for functional programming tasks

Task Highlights

0. Squared simple – Return a new matrix with squared values using loops
1. Search and replace – Replace a value with another in a new list
2. Unique addition – Add all unique integers from a list
3. Present in both – Return common elements between two sets
4. Only differents – Return elements that appear in only one of the sets
5. Number of keys – Return the number of keys in a dictionary
6. Print sorted dictionary – Print a dictionary sorted by keys
7. Update dictionary – Add or update a key/value in a dictionary
8. Simple delete by key – Remove a key from a dictionary if it exists
9. Multiply by 2 – Return a new dictionary with values doubled
10. Best score – Return the key with the highest value in a dictionary
11. Multiply by using map – Multiply list values using map (no loops)
12. Roman to Integer – Convert a Roman numeral string into an integer
13. Weighted average – Return the weighted average of scores
14. Squared using map – Return a squared matrix using map only
15. Delete by value – Remove all keys with a specific value
